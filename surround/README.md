## Operations with Delimiters
- Delete inside: E.g. typing `di)` inside `(self, *args, **kwargs)` will delete everything **except** the parentheses,
  leaving `()`
- Delete all: E.g. typing `da)` inside `(self, *args, **kwargs)` will delete everything **including** the parentheses,
  leaving an empty string
- Similarly, we have the yank equiv.: `yi)` and `ya)`.
