## Operations with Delimiters
- Delete inside: E.g. typing `di)` inside `(self, *args, **kwargs)` will delete everything **except** the parentheses,
  leaving `()`
- Delete around: E.g. `da)` will delete both the delimiters
  (here the parentheses) and the content
- Similarly, we have the yank equiv.: `yi)` and `ya)`.
    - and the visually select equiv.: `vi)` and `va)`.
